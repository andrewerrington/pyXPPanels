If using python3 replace pip by pip3
! on windows, need to check you have the correct visual studio installed (version used to compile your python version) in order to be able to use pip

1. Install python 3 

2. Install Numpy:
sudo pip3 install numpy

3. Install PyOpenGL: type in terminal
sudo pip3 install PyOpenGL 
sudo pip3 install PyOpenGL_accelerate

on windows:
pip3 install PyOpenGL 
pip3 install PyOpenGL_accelerate

4. install pyserial
pip3 install pyserial

4. Install Pillow
on linux to allow Pillow to compile install libjpeg first
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
 
sudo pip3 install Pillow


5. Install GLFW - MAC


download from http://www.glfw.org
to compile, follow the guide: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html
ensure you build a shared library - by default this compiles as a static library which does not work
feed the following option to cmake:
cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .
make
sudo make install

5. Install GLFW - LINUX
download glfw from http://www.glfw.org
install cmake: sudo apt-get install cmake
install dependencies: sudo apt-get install xorg-dev
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
to compile, follow the guide: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html
ensure you build a shared library - by default this compiles as a static library which does not work
feed the following option to cmake:
cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON .
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig	#to rebuild the library links


Windows: 
download the dll that corresponds to the python version you are running (e.g. if you are running python 32 bits download the 32 bits dll even if you are running windows 64)
copy the dll in the windows folder corresponding to the dll version (C:\Windows\System32 for 64 bits, C:\Windows\SysWOW64 for 32 bits)
I found that I had to use the dll corresponding to the visual studio version I had installed (VS 2010)
